This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## DX(Development experience) Notes

### 😩 json-server dev dependency

At start up data seem the pop up out of no where in spite of:

- 😬 NO globally installed json-server
- 😤 NO spinning json-server, 4000 port not running
- 🤯 Even deleting all the db.json file content

Making it impossible to update data.

**Where is the cache ???** (_No pun intended_)
